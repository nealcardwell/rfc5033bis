              Specifying New Congestion Control Algorithms
             draft-scheffenegger-congress-rfc5033bis-latest

Abstract

   The IETF's standard congestion control schemes have been widely shown
   to be inadequate for various environments (e.g., high-speed
   networks).  Recent research has yielded many alternate congestion
   control schemes that significantly differ from the IETF's congestion
   control principles.  Using these new congestion control schemes in
   the global Internet has possible ramifications to both the traffic
   using the new congestion control and to traffic using the currently
   standardized congestion control.  Therefore, the IETF must proceed
   with caution when dealing with alternate congestion control
   proposals.  The goal of this document is to provide guidance for
   considering alternate congestion control algorithms within the IETF.

1.  Introduction

   This document provides guidelines for the IETF to use when evaluating
   suggested congestion control algorithms that significantly differ
   from the general congestion control principles outlined in [RFC2914].
   The guidance is intended to be useful to authors proposing alternate
   congestion control and for the IETF community when evaluating whether
   a proposal is appropriate for publication in the RFC series.

   The guidelines in this document are intended to be consistent with
   the congestion control principles from [RFC2914] of preventing
   congestion collapse, considering fairness, and optimizing the flow's
   own performance in terms of throughput, delay, and loss.  [RFC2914]
   also discusses the goal of avoiding a congestion control "arms race"
   among competing transport protocols.

   This document does not give hard-and-fast requirements for an
   appropriate congestion control scheme.  Rather, the document provides
   a set of criteria that should be considered and weighed by the IETF
   in the context of each proposal.  The high-order criteria for any new
   proposal is that a serious scientific study of the pros and cons of
   the proposal needs to have been done such that the IETF has a well-
   rounded set of information to consider.

   After initial studies, we encourage authors to write a specification
   of their proposals for publication in the RFC series to allow others
   to concretely understand and investigate the wealth of proposals in
   this space.

2.  Document Status

   Following the lead of HighSpeed TCP [RFC3649], alternate congestion
   control algorithms are expected to be published as "Experimental"
   RFCs until such time that the community better understands the
   solution space.  Traditionally, the meaning of "Experimental" status
   has varied in its use and interpretation.  As part of this document
   we define two classes of congestion control proposals that can be
   published with the "Experimental" status.  The first class includes
   algorithms that are judged to be safe to deploy for best-effort
   traffic in the global Internet and further investigated in that
   environment.  The second class includes algorithms that, while
   promising, are not deemed safe enough for widespread deployment as
   best-effort traffic on the Internet, but are being specified to
   facilitate investigations in simulation, testbeds, or controlled
   environments.  The second class can also include algorithms where the
   IETF does not yet have sufficient understanding to decide if the
   algorithm is or is not safe for deployment on the Internet.

   Each alternate congestion control algorithm published is required to
   include a statement in the abstract indicating whether or not the
   proposal is considered safe for use on the Internet.  Each alternate
   congestion control algorithm published is also required to include a
   statement in the abstract describing environments where the protocol
   is not recommended for deployment.  There may be environments where
   the protocol is deemed _safe_ for use, but still is not _recommended_
   for use because it does not perform well for the user.

   As examples of such statements, [RFC3649] specifying HighSpeed TCP
   includes a statement in the abstract stating that the proposal is
   Experimental, but may be deployed in the current Internet.  In
   contrast, the Quick-Start document [RFC4782] includes a paragraph in
   the abstract stating the mechanism is only being proposed for
   controlled environments.  The abstract specifies environments where
   the Quick-Start request could give false positives (and therefore
   would be unsafe to deploy).  The abstract also specifies environments
   where packets containing the Quick-Start request could be dropped in
   the network; in such an environment, Quick-Start would not be unsafe
   to deploy, but deployment would still not be recommended because it
   could cause unnecessary delays for the connections attempting to use
   Quick-Start.

   For authors of alternate congestion control schemes who are not ready
   to bring their congestion control mechanisms to the IETF for
   standardization (either as Experimental or as Proposed Standard), one
   possibility would be to submit an internet-draft that documents the
   alternate congestion control mechanism for the benefit of the IETF
   and IRTF communities.  This is particularly encouraged in order to
   get algorithm specifications widely disseminated to facilitate
   further research.  Such an internet-draft could be submitted to be
   considered as an Informational RFC, as a first step in the process
   towards standardization.  Such a document would also be expected to
   carry an explicit warning against using the scheme in the global
   Internet.

   Note: we are not changing the RFC publication process for non-IETF
   produced documents (e.g., those from the IRTF or Independent
   Submissions via the RFC-Editor).  However, we would hope the
   guidelines in this document inform the IESG as they consider whether
   to add a note to such documents.

3.  Guidelines

   As noted above, authors are expected to do a well-rounded evaluation
   of the pros and cons of proposals brought to the IETF.  The following
   are guidelines to help authors and the IETF community.  Concerns that
   fall outside the scope of these guidelines are certainly possible;
   these guidelines should not be considered as an all-encompassing
   check-list.

   (0)  Differences with Congestion Control Principles [RFC2914]

      Proposed congestion control mechanisms should include a clear
      explanation of the deviations from [RFC2914].

   (1)  Impact on Standard TCP, SCTP [RFC2960], and DCCP [RFC4340].

      Proposed congestion control mechanisms should be evaluated when
      competing with standard IETF congestion control [RFC2581],
      [RFC2960], [RFC4340].  Alternate congestion controllers that have
      a significantly negative impact on traffic using standard
      congestion control may be suspect and this aspect should be part
      of the community's decision making with regards to the suitability
      of the alternate congestion control mechanism.

      We note that this bullet is not a requirement for strict TCP-
      friendliness as a prerequisite for an alternate congestion control
      mechanism to advance to Experimental.  As an example, HighSpeed
      TCP is a congestion control mechanism that is Experimental, but
      that is not TCP-friendly in all environments.  We also note that
      this guideline does not constrain the fairness offered for non-
      best-effort traffic.

      As an example from an Experimental RFC, fairness with standard TCP
      is discussed in Sections 4 and 6 of [RFC3649] (HighSpeed TCP) and
      using spare capacity is discussed in Sections 6, 11.1, and 12 of
      [RFC3649].

   (2)  Difficult Environments.

      The proposed algorithms should be assessed in difficult
      environments such as paths containing wireless links.
      Characteristics of wireless environments are discussed in
      [RFC3819] and in Section 16 of [Tools].  Other difficult
      environments can include those with multipath routing within a
      connection.  We note that there is still much to be desired in
      terms of the performance of TCP in some of these difficult
      environments.  For congestion control mechanisms with explicit
      feedback from routers, difficult environments can include paths
      with non-IP queues at layer-two, IP tunnels, and the like.  A
      minimum goal for experimental mechanisms proposed for widespread
      deployment in the Internet should be that they do not perform
      significantly worse than TCP in these environments.

      While it is impossible to enumerate all the possible "difficult
      environments", we note that the IETF has previously grappled with
      paths with long delays [RFC2488], high delay bandwidth products
      [RFC3649], high packet corruption rates [RFC3155], packet
      reordering [RFC4653], and significantly slow links [RFC3150].
      Aspects of alternate congestion control that impact networks with
      these characteristics should be detailed.

      As an example from an Experimental RFC, performance in difficult
      environments is discussed in Sections 6, 9.2, and 10.2 of
      [RFC4782] (Quick-Start).

   (3)  Investigating a Range of Environments.

      Similar to the last criteria, proposed alternate congestion
      controllers should be assessed in a range of environments.  For
      instance, proposals should be investigated across a range of
      bandwidths, round-trip times, levels of traffic on the reverse
      path, and levels of statistical multiplexing at the congested
      link.  Similarly, proposals should be investigated for robust
      performance with different queueing mechanisms in the routers,
      especially Random Early Detection (RED) [FJ03] and Drop-Tail.
      This evaluation is often not included in the internet-draft
      itself, but in related papers cited in the draft.

      A particularly important aspect of evaluating a proposal for
      standardization is in understanding where the algorithm breaks
      down.  Therefore, particular attention should be paid to
      characterizing the areas where the proposed mechanism does not
      perform well.

      As an example from an Experimental RFC, performance in a range of
      environments is discussed in Section 12 of [RFC3649] (HighSpeed
      TCP) and Section 9.7 of [RFC4782] (Quick-Start).

   (4)  Protection Against Congestion Collaps

      The alternate congestion control mechanism should either stop
      sending when the packet drop rate exceeds some threshold
      [RFC3714], or should include some notion of "full backoff".  For
      "full backoff", at some point the algorithm would reduce the
      sending rate to one packet per round-trip time and then
      exponentially backoff the time between single packet transmissions
      if congestion persists.  Exactly when either "full backoff" or a
      pause in sending comes into play will be algorithm-specific.
      However, as discussed in [RFC2914], this requirement is crucial to
      protect the network in times of extreme congestion.

      If "full backoff" is used, this bullet does not require that the
      full backoff mechanism must be identical to that of TCP [RFC2988].
      As an example, this bullet does not preclude full backoff
      mechanisms that would give flows with different round- trip times
      comparable bandwidth during backoff.

   (5)  Fairness within the Alternate Congestion Control Algorithm.

      In environments with multiple competing flows all using the same
      alternate congestion control algorithm, the proposal should
      explore how bandwidth is shared among the competing flows.

   (6)  Performance with Misbehaving Nodes and Outside Attackers.

      The proposal should explore how the alternate congestion control
      mechanism performs with misbehaving senders, receivers, or
      routers.  In addition, the proposal should explore how the
      alternate congestion control mechanism performs with outside
      attackers.  This can be particularly important for congestion
      control mechanisms that involve explicit feedback from routers
      along the path.

      As an example from an Experimental RFC, performance with
      misbehaving nodes and outside attackers is discussed in Sections
      9.4, 9.5, and 9.6 of [RFC4782] (Quick-Start).  This includes
      discussion of misbehaving senders and receivers; collusion between
      misbehaving routers; misbehaving middleboxes; and the potential
      use of Quick-Start to attack routers or to tie up available Quick-
      Start bandwidth.

   (7)  Responses to Sudden or Transient Events.

      The proposal should consider how the alternate congestion control
      mechanism would perform in the presence of transient events such
      as sudden congestion, a routing change, or a mobility event.
      Routing changes, link disconnections, intermittent link
      connectivity, and mobility are discussed in more detail in
      Section 17 of [Tools].

      As an example from an Experimental RFC, response to transient
      events is discussed in Section 9.2 of [RFC4782] (Quick-Start).

   (8)  Incremental Deployment.

      The proposal should discuss whether the alternate congestion
      control mechanism allows for incremental deployment in the
      targeted environment.  For a mechanism targeted for deployment in
      the current Internet, it would be helpful for the proposal to
      discuss what is known (if anything) about the correct operation of
      the mechanism with some of the equipment installed in the current
      Internet, e.g., routers, transparent proxies, WAN optimizers,
      intrusion detection systems, home routers, and the like.

      As a similar concern, if the alternate congestion control
      mechanism is intended only for specific environments (and not the
      global Internet), the proposal should consider how this intention
      is to be carried out.  The community will have to address the
      question of whether the scope can be enforced by simply stating
      the restrictions or whether additional protocol mechanisms are
      required to enforce the scoping.  The answer will necessarily
      depend on the change being proposed.

      As an example from an Experimental RFC, deployment issues are
      discussed in Sections 10.3 and 10.4 of [RFC4782] (Quick-Start).

4.  Minimum Requirements

   This section suggests minimum requirements for a document to be
   approved as Experimental with approval for widespread deployment in
   the global Internet.

   The minimum requirements for approval for widespread deployment in
   the global Internet include the following guidelines on: (1)
   assessing the impact on standard congestion control, (3)
   investigation of the proposed mechanism in a range of environments,
   (4) protection against congestion collapse, and (8) discussing
   whether the mechanism allows for incremental deployment.

   For other guidelines, i.e., (2), (5), (6), and (7), the author must
   perform the suggested evaluations and provide recommended analysis.
   Evidence that the proposed mechanism has significantly more problems
   than those of TCP should be a cause for concern in approval for
   widespread deployment in the global Internet.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document does not represent a change to any aspect of the TCP/IP
   protocol suite and therefore does not directly impact Internet
   security.  The implementation of various facets of the Internet's
   current congestion control algorithms do have security implications
   (e.g., as outlined in [RFC2581]).  Alternate congestion control
   schemes should be mindful of such pitfalls, as well, and should
   examine any potential security issues that may arise.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
